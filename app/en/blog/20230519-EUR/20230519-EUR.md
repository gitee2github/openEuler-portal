In the world of operating systems, the software package is privileged because its richness in content and handiness in distribution determine the user and developer experience to a great extent.

**openEuler User Repo** (EUR) is an individual software package hosting platform released by the openEuler community. It aims to provide an easy-to-use **software package distribution platform** for developers. The platform supports automatic software packaging from PyPI and RubyGems, supports continuous build to be automatically triggered through webhooks and will support one-click software packages import to the community from your personal repository in near future.
