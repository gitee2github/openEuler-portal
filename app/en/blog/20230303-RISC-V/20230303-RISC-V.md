On February 25, 2023, the openEuler community, joint with the CNRV community, held the RISC-V Meetup in Wuhan, attracting more than 40 enterprise and student developers.

openEuler RISC-V SIG maintainers presented participants with the latest progress and subsequent planning of the adaptation and optimization of the openEuler on the RISC-V architecture, and demonstrated the advantages of openEuler in supporting diversified computing architectures.

Like-minded developers communicated with each other face-to-face about the RISC-V architecture and the powerful functions and reliability of openEuler.

Beside the adaptation progress of openEuler on the RISC-V architecture, openEuler RISC-V SIG maintainer Wu Wei shared the news and activities of the RISC-V international community. Developers on site gained a better understanding of the openEuler RISC-V SIG and how to access more open source content.

RISC-V SIG is an important part of the openEuler community for multi-architecture support. We welcome interested developers to join us and make contributions.
