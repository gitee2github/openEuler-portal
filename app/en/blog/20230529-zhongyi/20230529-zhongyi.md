Summary:   
China Mobile Online Marketing Service Center (hereinafter referred to as China Mobile Online) has officially launched the migration of its network-wide call platform, which is the core service system of the company. The migration was completed within a span of 2 days, taking only 6 hours. In the initial phase, 1050 sets of call platform systems were seamlessly and effectively migrated from CentOS (versions 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6) to openEuler. 

China Mobile Online owns the world's largest call platform, which is structured around the 'center and edges' model and operates on the principle of 'centralized control and distributed media'. In other words, it deployed Luoyang Huai'an central equipment room as its center with 31 sub-center equipment rooms, and over 7000 bare metal servers (BMSs) and virtual machines (VMs) deployed throughout.  

This migration involves 17 sub-centers and over 1000 service instances. This migration also marks the debut of the openEuler's "3 hot features": kernel hot patch, kernel hot replacement, and OS hot upgrade. The entire migration process is stable and efficient, with progress  visualized, and services uninterrupted ensuring no impact on user experience. China Mobile Online has already migrated nearly 30,000 OSs. With the official kick-off of the migration of its core service systems, it is expected that over 70,000 OSs will be migrated by the end of this year.

China Mobile Online efficiently and smoothly migrated 1050 OSs, including physical machines and VMs, from CentOS (versions 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6) to openEuler 20.03 LTS SP3 on May 24-25. The migration involved core services such as 17 sub-centers of the network-wide call platform, around 20 service subsystems and over 1000 service instances. It is the world's largest call platform. The entire migration process took six hours, and after the migration, service systems became more efficient and stable, and system O&M became easier.

The successful OS migration sets a benchmark in the telecom industry, accumulated valuable experience for potential OS migration of other services of China Mobile Online, and provided the openEuler community with excellent examples of technical roadmap and tools for migrating from CentOS. This achievement also offers a new option for enterprises seeking to migrate away from CentOS.
 
The three hot features (kernel hot patch, kernel hot replacement, and OS hot upgrade) of openEuler are put into large-scale commercial use for the first time. With just a single command, these features can fix kernel vulnerabilities, upgrade the kernel, and hot upgrade the entire OS. The entire migration process is stable and efficient. The migration progress is visualized, and services are not interrupted and felt.

In recent years, CentOS's end of maintenance has made enterprises think about system migration. As a donor to the openEuler Committee, China Mobile has been collaborating with the openEuler community to explore solutions to this issue.
 
With the joint efforts of both sides, the openEuler community has provided a comprehensive set of OS migration technologies. To ensure automatic OS migration and professional and standardized migration processes, the openEuler community has released the x2openEuler migration tool which has enabled China Mobile Online to successfully migrate their OS.
 
 
The efficient and smooth migration fully verifies the feasibility, stability, and reliability of the CentOS migration technologies and tools by the openEuler community.


Next, the openEuler community will leverage the power of the open source community to continuously enhance and upgrade the CentOS migration technology and tools, enabling more enterprises to seamlessly and efficiently migrate to openEuler.
